# Kickstarting with Excel
Completed Excel File: [VBA_Challenge](https://github.com/aimeeyen/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm)

## Overview of Project
Refactoring VBA code with array, improving data processing time and logic to increate ability to handle larger dataset. 

### Purpose
Examine if refactoring VBA code yield same result in faster processing time. With this refactoring VBA code, user are able to expand dataset to thousands of stocks and requiring less effort in execution of larger dataset.

## Results

Ability to analyze 3000+ rows of stock market data, compiled into high-level summary returns.

## Summary
 - :x: Disadvantage: The process of refactoring code is time consuming and requires series of trials and error experiements. Sometimes it may take days to come up with a better logic and downfall is during the process, one have no idea if the code will EVER work. 
 - :white_check_mark: Advantage: After the success of working code, the coder are able to imrpoved the design of code, apply and implement and address the needs of the user.
