# Kickstarting with Excel
Completed Excel File: [VBA_Challenge](https://github.com/aimeeyen/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm)

## Overview of Project
Refactoring VBA code with array, improving data processing time and logic to increate ability to handle larger dataset. 

### Purpose
Examine if refactoring VBA code yield same result in faster processing time. With this refactoring VBA code, user are able to expand dataset to thousands of stocks and requiring less effort in execution of larger dataset.

## Results

Ability to analyze 3000+ rows of stock market data, compiled into high-level summary returns.

## Summary
 - :x: Disadvantage: The process of refactoring code is very time consuming and requires series of trials and error experiements. Sometimes it may take days to come up with a better logic and downfall is during the process, one have no idea if the code will EVER work. it's like reinventing the wheels all over again. 
 - :white_check_mark: Advantage: After the success of working code, the coder are able to furthur improve their skillset, the logic design of code, apply, implement and address the needs of its user.
 
 - :x: Con: For me particularly, it tooked me days of researching, running around in fraustration in trying to get the code to compile. The process is quite excruciating :dizzy_face:. 
 - :white_check_mark: Pro: Again, coding is like fighting the war, you have no idea how it will end, during the process is unbearable, however when you come out winning, the feeling is amazing and a huge relief. It's like finally able to completed all sides of Rubiks cube! Much like the saying "No pain, no gain!" :sweat_smile:
